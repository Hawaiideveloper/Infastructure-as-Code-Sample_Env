### Automating Installation:

To automate the ESXi installation and configuration, you typically use Kickstart scripts (`ks.cfg`). The Kickstart script can define settings like root password, network configuration, license key, etc. However, automating OVA deployment is more complex and typically requires additional steps using ESXi Shell or Secure Shell (SSH) after the installation.

### Steps:

1. **Create Kickstart Script:**

   Create a `ks.cfg` with your configurations. Below is an example of what it might contain. Adjust as per your needs.
 

2. **Install ESXi with Kickstart Script:**
   
   Place the `ks.cfg` on a USB stick or make it available via HTTP and boot the Mac Pro from the ESXi installation media. At the boot menu, you would specify the location of the `ks.cfg`.

   If the `ks.cfg` is available via HTTP, you might type:
   ```shell
   runweasel ks=http://<webserver_ip>/ks.cfg
   ```

3. **Deploy OVA:**
   
   Once ESXi is installed, enabled, and configured, connect to the ESXi host using SSH or ESXi Shell. You can use `ovftool` to deploy the OVA. `ovftool` is a command-line utility that allows you to import and export OVF packages.

   Here’s a basic example:
   ```shell
   ovftool --name=VM_NAME --datastore=DATASTORE_NAME --network=NETWORK_NAME PATH_TO_OVA_FILE vi://root@ESXI_HOST/
   ```
   Replace `VM_NAME`, `DATASTORE_NAME`, `NETWORK_NAME`, `PATH_TO_OVA_FILE`, and `ESXI_HOST` with your details.

### Important Notes:

- Before you proceed, please review VMware’s documentation about [Automating ESXi Installations](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.esxi.install.doc/GUID-C03B2B8C-6E3C-4B57-9C49-713B5DA655E4.html) and [ovftool](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/ovf/).
- Testing the entire process in a safe environment before applying it to the production system is crucial to avoid any data loss or system downtime.
- Some of the script parts might need to be adjusted based on the ESXi version and specific configurations of your environment.
