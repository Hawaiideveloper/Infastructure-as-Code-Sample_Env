####  Step 1: Read the README so you know what is the plan!

####  Step 2: AWS  console
 - [ ] Use this [link](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) to quickly find it and setup an account
 - [x] Use this if you already have an AWS account [link to login](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fconsole%2Fhome%3Fstate%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fhomepage&forceMobileApp=0&code_challenge=dlhxv7rVnZ0x4unaEqcagTwHiG4e80jbd2ij_UMuq-0&code_challenge_method=SHA-256)
 
### Step 3: Go to the Security, Identity, & Compliance Section and select IAM
### Step 4: Look on the left under Access Management and search for Users


## Recommendation #1
Get yourself a [password manager](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/best-password-manager-to-use-for-2020-1password-lastpass-and-more-compared/) that can record passwords for you or use the old school paper and pad
However thing could really suck if you are away from your paper and pad and need to do something magical from a plane because of an emergency:
- I have been on flights and with family and my job needs me to do something and I forgot that paper at home
    - [x] Lastpass is my 1st choice
    - [ ] Keepass is my  2nd choice



####  Go to your favorite web browser 
- [x] I like google chrome, but feel free to use your favorite one that supports JavaScript
    - [x] Google provides a console that is seemless and also allows me to inspect elements as well as change thigns real-time and see the effects immediately


 
 
 
 
 #### Next setup a service user ... i.e. never use the root account as you could end up with
 - unautorized access
 - make sure to add it to your password mananager
