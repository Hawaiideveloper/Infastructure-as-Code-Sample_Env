Yes, Vagrant uses VirtualBox (or another provider) to create a virtual machine. All the changes you make inside the VM, such as installing software or changing settings, are stored within the VMâ€™s disk image, and they are persistent across reboots and shutdowns of the VM.

However, there are a couple of nuances to be aware of:
1. **Vagrant Destroy**: When you run `vagrant destroy`, it will delete the VM and all its contents. The script you have will destroy the existing VM before creating a new one, so running the script again will result in a fresh GitLab installation.
2. **Vagrant Provisioning**: The provisioning steps defined in the `Vagrantfile` (installing GitLab, etc.) are typically only run once when the VM is first created. If you run `vagrant up` on an existing VM, those steps won't be run again unless you explicitly run `vagrant provision`.

To ensure that your GitLab data and configurations are not lost, you may want to set up regular backups of the GitLab instance, or consider using volumes/mounts to store the GitLab data outside of the VM.

### Backing Up GitLab Data
GitLab has built-in backup and restore functionality. You can set up a cron job or another scheduled task inside the VM to run the GitLab backup command regularly. Here is an example command to create a backup of GitLab:

```sh
gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:create
```

This will create a backup archive file in the `./var/opt/gitlab/backups/` directory inside the VM by default.

### Restoring GitLab Data
If something goes wrong, you can restore GitLab from a backup file. First, copy the backup file to the `./var/opt/gitlab/backups/` directory inside the VM, then run the following command:

```sh
gitlab-ctl stop unicorn
gitlab-ctl stop sidekiq
gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:restore BACKUP=<backup-filename>
```

Replace `<backup-filename>` with the filename of the backup archive (without the path).

Please refer to the [official GitLab backup and restore documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/backup_restore.html) for more details and options.
