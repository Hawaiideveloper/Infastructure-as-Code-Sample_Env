#The error message you received is because your local branch and the remote branch have 
#diverged, meaning there are commits in your local branch that are not in the remote branch, 
#and/or there are commits in the remote branch that are not in your local branch.
#Here's how you can reconcile them, based on the options hinted in the error message:
#This will merge the changes from the remote main branch into your local branch. 
#Any conflicts will need to be resolved manually. This method will create a new merge commit if
# there are changes in the local branch.


#This will reapply your local commits on top of the incoming commits from the remote main branch. 
#Any conflicts during this process will need to be resolved manually. 
#Rebasing creates a linear commit history, but be cautious as it rewrites commit history.

#This will only update the local branch if it is a fast-forward, meaning your local branch is strictly 
#behind the remote branch and there are no divergent changes. 
#If the branches have diverged, this command will fail, and you will need to use merge or rebase.

#This sets rebase as the default behavior for git pull for all your repositories (due to the --global flag). 
#You can replace true with false to set merging as the default behavior, 
#or with only to set fast-forward only as the default behavior.



#If you are unsure of the state of your branches and want to manually handle the divergence, 
#you might want to fetch the changes first, 
#review them, and then decide how to reconcile.

#git fetch origin main
#git log main..origin/main   # see what is in the remote branch that you don't have
#git log origin/main..main   # see what you have that the remote branch doesn't have
